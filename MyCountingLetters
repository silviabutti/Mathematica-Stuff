more savage, more appalling, more hellish, be conceived than that \
dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of \
fog";

  "A thick,black cloud swirled before my eyes,and my mind told me \
that in this cloud,unseen as yet,but about to spring out upon my \
appalled senses,lurked all that was vaguely horrible,all that was \
monstrous and inconceivably wicked in the universe.Vague shapes \
swirled and swam amid the dark cloud-bank,each a menace and a warning \
of something coming,the advent of some unspeakable dweller upon the \
threshold,whose very shadow would blast my soul.";

  "Fog everywhere.Fog up the river,where it flows among green aits \
and meadows;fog down the river,where it rolls defiled among the tiers \
of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) \
city.Fog on the Essex marshes,fog on the Kentish heights.Fog creeping \
into the cabooses of collier-brigs;fog lying out on the yards,and \
hovering in the rigging of great ships;fog drooping on the gunwales \
of barges and small boats.Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient \
Greenwich pensioners,wheezing by the firesides of their wards;fog in \
the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,down \
in his close cabin;fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his \
shivering little\[CloseCurlyQuote]prentice boy on deck.Chance people \
on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of \
fog,with fog all round them,as if they were up in a balloon,and \
hanging in the misty clouds.Gas looming through the fog in divers \
places in the streets,much as the sun may,from the spongey fields,be \
seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy.Most of the shops lighted \
two hours before their time\[LongDash]as the gas seems to know,for it \
has a haggard and unwilling look.The raw afternoon is rawest,and the \
dense fog is densest,and the muddy streets are muddiest near that \
leaden-headed old obstruction,appropriate ornament for the threshold \
of a leaden-headed old corporation,Temple Bar.And hard by Temple \
Bar,in Lincoln\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Inn Hall,at the very heart of the \
fog,sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.";
